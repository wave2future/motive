* Installation *

1. Bring this project's structure into your project's structure, a git submodule is a good start.

2. Add motive.xcodeproj to your project.

3. For each of your targets, add Motive's "motive" target as a direct dependency of the target (Target -> Command-I -> General -> Direct Dependencies).

4. For each of your targets, ensure libmotive.a is included (linked against).

5. In your project, add Motive's main directory to your Header Search Paths (HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS), e.g. $(SRCROOT)/Source/External/motive/Source/Main

6. Import MV/MVPrelude.h where you want to use Motive, your prefix header is a good spot.
